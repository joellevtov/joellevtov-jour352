    <p> Senior journalism major Brandie Bland’s class was discussing how to cover situations without mentioning a person’s race about two months ago. She pointed out that communities of color are often written about in a dehumanizing way. Then her classmate chimed in. </p>

    <p> “There are people in this country,” her classmate said, “that like to pretend like they are still affected by slavery, like they are slaves themselves.” </p>

    <p> Bland said her experience at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism has been filled with such racism, whether overt or not. </p>

    <p> “It’s like, pick what kind of racism do you want today? Do you want it in your face? Do you want microaggressions?” Bland said. “Every day is different.” </p>

    <p> Her classmate’s comment was unusual in how direct it was. But Bland isn’t unique in feeling like a fish out of water – out of 12 undergraduate students of color interviewed for this article, 10 said they’ve felt out of place in Merrill.</p>
